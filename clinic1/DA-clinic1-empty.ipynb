With higher education facing severe budget cuts, the government is looking for creative solutions to \"do more with less.\" Convinced by the stunning progress in language modeling, officials believe LLMs could help battle growing teacher shortages and reduce costs by automating parts of the education process.

Most providers of state-of-the-art LMs use this dataset to showcase the versatility of their latest models. Unfortunately, the intern responsible for collecting the results, didn‚Äôt pay attention during DACS KEN3450: Data Analysis. As a result, the collected datasets are slightly corrupted. Jammer!\n",

    "### A very brief primer on Language Models\n",
    "We studied LLMs in the context of the NLP course but here is a short reminder. Language models (LMs) are sophisticated statistical models designed to understand and generate human-like text. At their core, LMs are trained to predict the most likely continuation of a given input text. For example, given the input \"The cat sat on the,\" an LM might predict \"mat\" as a likely continuation.\n",
    "LMs are trained on vast text samples from various sources, including books, websites, and social media. This extensive training allows them to capture patterns and relationships in language, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text across a wide range of topics and styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "While LMs can produce text that appears to be written by intelligent humans, it's important to note that their capabilities can diverge from human intelligence in unexpected ways. They may sometimes generate factually incorrect information or struggle with complex reasoning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key concepts in understanding LMs are:\n",
    "1. **Tokens**: LMs process text using \"tokens\" rather than individual characters. Tokens can be words, parts of words, or punctuation marks. For example, the sentence \"I love AI!\" might be tokenized as [\"I\", \"love\", \"AI\", \"!\"]. Tokenization is the first step in both training and using an LM.\n",
    "2. **Context**: The input text provided to an LM is called the \"context.\" This context informs the model's predictions or generations. A longer or more specific context often leads to more accurate and relevant outputs.\n",
